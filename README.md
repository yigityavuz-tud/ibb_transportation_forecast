# Istanbul Metro Passenger Forecasting

This project aims to forecast passenger demand for Istanbul's metro system using various external factors, including weather, holidays, football schedules, school terms, and Ramadan dates. The forecasting pipeline integrates data collection, preprocessing, and machine learning modeling.

## Features

- Loads and processes transportation, weather, and event-based data.

-  Utilizes preprocessing techniques to clean and merge datasets.

-  Implements a machine learning model for forecasting passenger demand.

- Visualizes results using data-driven insights.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

## Usage

Run the main notebook or script to load, process, and forecast metro passenger demand:
'''
python main.py
'''

Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, execute the cells sequentially in panel.ipynb.

## Data Sources

This project utilizes multiple datasets:

Metro Passenger Data: [Historical metro ridership data](https://data.ibb.gov.tr/dataset/hourly-public-transport-data-set) (With daily aggregation)

Weather Data: Temperature, precipitation, and other weather factors.

Holidays & Events: Public holidays, football match schedules, school terms, and Ramadan dates.

I will upload empty files only with the column names to provide the schema blueprint.
